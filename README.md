# FPGA Snake Game

This project implements different audio visual display features on a Basys 3 FPGA. The main feature is a voice-controlled snake game which uses the pitch of a sound to control whether the snake moves left or right.

A demo of the voice-controlled sname game can be seen here (click photo for link or visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdfPtCyzK9w):
